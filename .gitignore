# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
services/app/log/*
services/app/tmp/*
!services/app/log/.keep
!services/app/tmp/.keep

# Ignore Byebug command history file.
.byebug_history
.env
production.env
